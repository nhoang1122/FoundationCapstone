Project Name : Ghetto Gourmet (work in progress LOL)

Project Idea/Summary :  An application where you can find all sorts of different recipes ranging from different cuisines. 

//MVPS// 

You will be able to BROWSE the whole recipe database (Maybe I will Separate by Cuisines. I am imagining Netflix and how they are separated by Movie/Show Categories.)

You will be able to SEARCH for a recipe. I will have a search bar and depending on what is typed in, it will pull the recipe card for you. 

You will be able to STORE recipes (Whether it is something you plan to cook or a recipe that you may have used).

You will be able to RATE the Recipes by STARS (1-5 with 5 being the highest).

There will be a DARK MODE vs LIGHT MODE.

There will be a randomizer button that will shoot out a random recipe for when you are uninspired. 

//CODING//
    
Will need AXIOS for Get, Post, and Put functions

Will need a Controller File to make Code Clean

Might make a db.json file to store my recipes since I donâ€™t want to use an API

Or, I may do a seed function to create the tables. 

HTML, CSS, JS will all be used.
